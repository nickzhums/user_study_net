Quickstart Tutorial - Resource Management (Preview Libraries)
=============================================================

We are excited to announce that a new set of management libraries are
now in Public Preview. Those packages share a number of new features
such as Azure Identity support, HTTP pipeline, error-handling.,etc, and
they also follow the new Azure SDK guidelines which create easy-to-use
APIs that are idiomatic, compatible, and dependable.

You can find the details of those new libraries
[here](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/#dotnet)

In this basic quickstart guide, we will walk you through how to
authenticate to Azure using the preview libraries and start interacting
with Azure resources. There are several possible approaches to
authentication. This document illustrates the most common scenario

Prerequisites
-------------

You will need the following values to authenticate to Azure

-   **Subscription ID**
-   **Client ID**
-   **Client Secret**
-   **Tenant ID**

These values can be obtained from the portal, here's the instructions:

### Get Subscription ID

1.  Login into your Azure account
2.  Select Subscriptions in the left sidebar
3.  Select whichever subscription is needed
4.  Click on Overview
5.  Copy the Subscription ID

### Get Client ID / Client Secret / Tenant ID

For information on how to get Client ID, Client Secret, and Tenant ID,
please refer to [this
document](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal)

### Setting Environment Variables

After you obtained the values, you need to set the following values as
your environment variables

-   `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
-   `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
-   `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
-   `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`

To set the following environment variables on your development system:

Windows (Note: Administrator access is required)

1.  Open the Control Panel
2.  Click System Security, then System
3.  Click Advanced system settings on the left
4.  Inside the System Properties window, click the Environment
    Variables… button.
5.  Click on the property you would like to change, then click the Edit…
    button. If the property name is not listed, then click the New…
    button.

Linux-based OS :

    export AZURE_CLIENT_ID="__CLIENT_ID__"
    export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="__CLIENT_SECRET__"
    export AZURE_TENANT_ID="__TENANT_ID__"
    export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="__SUBSCRIPTION_ID__"

Authentication and Creating Resource Management Client
------------------------------------------------------

Now that the environment is setup, all you need to do is to create an
authenticated client. Our default option is to use
**DefaultAzureCredential** and in this guide we have picked
**Resources** as our target service, but you can set it up similarly for
any other service that you are using.

To authenticate to Azure and create a management client, simply do the
following:
```csharp
    using Azure.Identity;
    using Azure.Management.Resources;
    using Azure.Management.Resources.Models;
    using System;
    ...
    var subscriptionId = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID");
    var resourceClient = new ResourcesManagementClient(subscriptionId, new DefaultAzureCredential());
    var resourceGroupsClient = resourceClient.GetResourceGroupsClient();
```
From this code snippet, we showed that in order to interact with Resources, we need to create a top-level client first (**ResourcesManagementClient**), then get the corresponding sub-resource client we are interested in, in this case we called **.GetResourceGroupsClient()** to get a ResourceGroupsClient

For more information and different authentication approaches using Azure
Identity can be found in [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/overview/azure/identity-readme?view=azure-dotnet)

Interacting with Azure Resources
--------------------------------

Now that we are authenticated, we can use our management client to make API calls. Let's demonstrate management client's usage by showing concrete examples

Example: Managing Resource Groups
---------------------------------
We can use the Resource client (``Azure.Management.Resources.ResourcesManagementClient``) we have created to perform operations on Resource Group. In this example, we will show to manage Resource Groups.

***Create a resource group***

```csharp
    var location = "westus2";
    var resourceGroupName = "myResourceGroupName";
    var resourceGroup = new ResourceGroup(location);
    resourceGroup = await resourceGroupsClient.CreateOrUpdateAsync(resourceGroupName, resourceGroup);
```

***Update a resource group***

```csharp
    ...
    var resourceGroupName = "myResourceGroupName";
    var tags = new Dictionary<string,string>();
    tags.Add("environment","test");
    tags.Add("department","tech");
    resourceGroup.Tags = tags;

    resourceGroup = await resourceGroupsClient.CreateOrUpdateAsync(resourceGroupName, resourceGroup);
```


***List all resource groups***

```csharp
    AsyncPageable<ResourceGroup> response = resourceGroupsClient.ListAsync();
    await foreach (ResourceGroup resourceGroup in response)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(resourceGroup.Name);
    }
```

***Delete a resource group***

```csharp
    await resourceGroupsClient.StartDeleteAsync(groupName);
```
