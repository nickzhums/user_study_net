Hi @GithubUsername

For .NET, the development focus shifted to the next generation of Azure SDKs which follows the [new SDK guideline](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_introduction.html) and introduces a set of important new featuers. For .NET, the packages are currently in preview state and we are actively working on making it production ready. You can visit [this link here](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/mgmt/dotnet.html) to see the latest .NET packages: 

We have also published a few blog posts on why we are doing this:

With this background, .NET Fluent is currently in a low maintenance mode, and we mostly do security and bug fixes. Let us know if there are further questions, thanks!
